				<h2>Shoes</h2>
			</header>

			<p>There are five kinds of ice-skating shoes for different purples, figure skates, hockey skates, bandy skates, racing skates and touring skates. If you are new to ice skating and don’t have any plan to play Hockey, you should try figure skates. If you have plan to play hockey, try hockey skates, which is the easiest one. Racing skates is not suitable for new player, but like its name, it’s fast.</p>
            <p><img src="images/Figure_Skates.jpg" style="float:left;width:128px;height:128px;"/>Figure skates are suitable for new player for skating and after you are good at ice skating, you can play figure skating. I believe You will love your figure skates.
            </p>
            <p>Figure skates are used in the sport of figure skating. Unlike hockey skates, they have toe picks on the front of the blade, which are usually made out of stainless steel or aluminium with a steel runner. The toe pick has a variety of uses, but is most commonly used for certain jumps in figure skating, such as the Lutz jump and toe loop or starting a backspin. Figure skating boots are typically made of several layers of leather and the leather is very stiff to provide ankle support. In addition, the figure skate's blade is curved, allowing for minute adjustments in balance and weight distribution.
            </p>
            <p>The base of the figure-skate blade is slightly concave, or "hollow ground." The hollow, which runs the length of the blade, creates two edges, which come in contact with the ice. The forward part of the blade, the toe-rake, is saw-toothed and is used for jumps and spins on the toes.[6]
            </p>
            <p><img src="images/Ice_Hockey_Skates.jpg" style="float:left;width:128px;height:128px;"/>As its name, hockey skates are for playing hockey. This kind of skates are the easy one for new skater. You can buy one as your first skates and learning ice skating with them.
            </p>
            <p>Hockey skates are used for playing the games of ice hockey and ringette. The boot is generally made of molded plastic, leather (often synthetic), and ballistic nylon. Skates used in competitive hockey rarely use molded plastic for the upper boot, as this results in limited mobility.
                The skates used by goaltenders are cut lower in the ankle than a normal hockey skate and the boot sits closer to the ice for a lower center of gravity. The boot itself is encased in hardened plastic, called a "cowling", protecting the toe, ankle and heel from the force of the shot puck. The blade is usually longer and has less rocker (curvature to the blade) to make it easier for the goalie to move side to side in the crease. Goalie skates lack a tendon guard. Unlike regular hockey skates, goalie skates are usually protected by a synthetic material covering the toe-part of the skate. This is to prevent damage from the puck. The blade of the goalie skate is not as useful in turning as regular hockey skates, because the blade is rockered less, thus making turns slightly inconvenient. The material used to make the boot of the goalie skate is a harder synthetic material than regular hockey boots.
                Sharpening ice hockey skates plays a key factor in a player’s ability to skate and players will sharpen their skates hundreds of times throughout their career. Similar to figure skates, the blade is hollow ground in cross section, creating two edges that contact and cut into the ice, allowing increased maneuverability. The blades are sharpened with round-edged grinding wheels that create the two edges. The wheels grind out a hollow semi-circle along the length of the underside of the blade, forming the sharp edge on each side. Skate blade sharpness is measured by the thickness of the round-edged grinding wheel being used, the smaller the radius, the sharper the edge will be. The sharpness chosen by a player is based completely upon preference, not player size or level of play. While a one-half-inch (13 mm) radius of hollow is the most common and standard sharpening for most players, the standard radius of hollow for goalies is three-quarters inch (19 mm).[citation needed]
            </p>
            <p><img src="images/bandyskates.jpeg" style="float:left;width:128px;height:128px;"/>Bandy skates are used for playing the game of bandy. The boot is generally made of leather (often synthetic). The boot is lower than the hockey version, often not covering the ankles. All bandy skates are designed such that they will not cause injury to an opponent. The blade is generally an inch longer than the hockey skates, allowing for higher speeds at the large bandy rink.[7] The Russian bandy skates have an even longer blade and a very low cut shoe.
            </p>
            <p><img src="images/racingskates.png" style="float:left;width:128px;height:128px;"/>Racing skates if not for new ice skater, but them can be fast. You will like this one if you like speed. You can buy one after you familiar with ice skating.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p><img src="images/touringskates.jpg" style="float:left;width:128px;height:128px;"/>Touring skates (or Nordic skates) are long blades that can be attached, via bindings, to hiking or cross-country ski boots and are used for long distance tour skating on natural ice. The blades are approximately 50 cm (20 in) long with a radius of curvature (or rocker) of about 25 m (82 ft). The blades are from 1 to 1.5 mm (0.04 to 0.06 in) wide, with a flat cross-section. The length and long radius of the blades makes touring skates more stable on uneven natural ice than skates with shorter, more rockered blades. Since tour skating often involves walking (Kluning) between lakes or around unskateable sections, the fact that the blades can be easily removed from one's boots is an asset. Thus, these skates are often called kluunschaats in the Netherlands.[10]
